# FOSSdroid.org
FOSSdroid.org is a Wiki created by the team over at [r/FOSSdroid](https://www.reddit.com/r/fossdroid) on Reddit. The goal of this project is to have a centralized list of FOSS Android projects and apps, as well as guides for how to install, troubleshoot, and maintain such tools! Once this Wiki is fully functional, we may create a Forum for FOSSdroid.org as well, which would run on FOSS forum software and would serve as an alternative to the subreddit.

# Code of Conduct
When creating Pull Requests and Issues, we just ask that you are kind to other users. Please refrain from using swear words and other foul language when contributing to the project or interacting with other users. Anyone who is being foul or trolling others in Issues or Pull Requests may be removed from the project. Maintainers are expected to only approve contributions that are complete, as free of errors as possible, and as non-opinionated as possible. Due to the nature of the FOSS community and philosophy, it is impossible to completely remove bias and opinion from everything, but we ask that politics stay out of the project as much as possible. That said, bigotry of any kind is grounds for removal, as people involved in the project may be parts of minority communities, who are impacted by bigoted speech.
