## How to contribute
Once you have made changes in your local git repository, please push it to your own GitHub remote. From there, you can create a pull request here. Once changes are approved, it will be merged automatically. Once we have CI/CD set up, it will use that to test your PR to make sure it is valid and will compile correctly.

## Maintainers
To become a maintainer, you must have made prior good contributions and be willing to moderate new PRs. It helps to be active on Issues and PRs, such as replying with potential fixes, creating PRs for issues, and giving people feedback on their PRs. If I see good activity, you may be added as a maintainer with access to approve and manage PRs and Issues.
