# What is FOSS?

For the purposes of this wiki and for r/FOSSdroid, FOSS apps must:
- Have a FOSS license\*
- Be open source
- Be free, as in freedom

They must not:
- Have a proprietary EULA\*\*

\*A FOSS license is any typical open-source license. Common examples:
- GPLv3
- GPLv2
- Apache 2.0
- Mozilla MPL
- And many more  
*The above section needs work, and should be updated to include more FOSS licenses.*

\*\*A proprietary EULA:
- Is listed as an End User License Agreement, or
- Has provisions typical of proprietary software, or
- Removes one of the [FOSS freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

## What are the FOSS Freedoms?
As used by the GNU project, the FOSS freedoms require that users can do the following: 
- Run
- Copy
- Distrubute
- Study
- Change, or
- Improve

Anything that violates *any of these rights* is enough to be no longer considered FOSS.

Luckily, there's a simple way to tell! If it's on F-Droid by default, it's FOSS enough for us. If it has one of the above mentioned FOSS licenses, it is too.
