# Introduction
Welcome to the FOSSdroid.org Wiki, created by the team behind [r/FOSSdroid](https://www.reddit.com/r/fossdroid) over on Reddit. We plan to create a forum eventually, which will serve as a fully FOSS way to talk to other FOSS Android users.

# Purpose
The purpose of this Wiki is to create, serve, and maintain guides for anyone who wants to use FOSS Android applications.

# Philosophy
Our philosophy is centered around decentralization, privacy, and user control. We propose that users should have full control over their devices, applications, and life. While we are fundamentally non-political, we recognize that FOSS is inherently political currently. We strive to create a non-political space for FOSS discussion, while also fostering a healthy community without trolling, hostility, and aggression.

# Contribution
If you are interested in contributing to the project, please check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FOSSdroid-org/FOSSdroid.org). The README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files are a great starting place. Feel free to create Issues if you are not familiar with the contribution process, or you may directly contribute modifications by submitting a Pull Request. Once approved, we anticipate that Pull Requests will update on the site within minutes. This is, however, dependent on completion of the CI/CD pipeline.

Due to the lead maintainer's experience in creating her own GitHub Actions pipeline for [her website](https://katiethe.dev), we anticipate that this will not take too long.

# Copyright
FOSSdroid.org is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://github.com/FOSSdroid-org/FOSSdroid.org/blob/main/LICENSE). All contributions are governed by this license, so feel free to use any contents of the site in accordance with licensing requirements!

We also will be taking inspiration from many [DivestOS Wiki pages](https://divestos.org/index.html), especially since their project is now defunct. Licensing information can be found [here](https://github.com/Divested-Mobile/DivestOS-Website/blob/master/LICENSE). We strive to build off of their work in a respectful way, therefore we have obtained permission from their founder.

# What can you expect to see here?
This Wiki will serve as a hub for guides, lists, and FOSS alternatives for proprietary apps. This will be accomplished by compiling existing lists on our subreddit, finding new materials, and compiling existing knowlege of contributors.

# Donations
We do not currently accept donations. We may in the future, but this is currently 100% volunteer-run, just like r/FOSSdroid is! If you see anyone soliciting donations, please ignore them, as they are likely a scammer. This page will be updated if/when we begin accepting donations. This may happen if we have to start expanding infrastructure for the site, but the lead maintainer is currently hosting this site on her homelab.
