# Browsers

For the most up-to-date browser privacy tests, please visit the [privacytests.org](https://privacytests.org/android.html) browser test page! 

Browsers generally fall within three categories: Gecko-based, Blink-based, and WebView browsers. Gecko is the browser engine used by Firefox and its derivatives, while Blink is used by Chromium and its derivatives. WebView browsers rely on a WebView provider installed on your device (like Android System WebView). These browsers are often much smaller in size, but are far more limited in their privacy and security capabilities.

## WebView-based

TODO

## Browsers to avoid

Generally, you should avoid browsers that are proprietary and/or not actively maintained and updated. Outdated browsers can pose a huge security risk, especially if you visit less reputable websites.

TODO: add more browsers
