# Posting Guidelines
> The purpose of this subreddit is to promote, develop, and expand the ability of users to choose FOSS alternatives on Android. To meet this goal, the subreddit is primarily focused on compiling, suggesting, and requesting FOSS Android apps. 

*Rule 1, r/FOSSdroid*

Keeping in mind the purpose of our subreddit, as well as the [community rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/fossdroid/about/), we have created the following Posting Guidelines: 
# Post Flairs
Post flairs must be consistent with the content. As such, we've created the following flairs: 
1. Application Request
	- The *Application Request* flair is used when you're requesting an app. This is not to be conflated with the *Application Suggestion* flair. 
2. Application Support
	- The *Application Support* flair is used when you're in need of support/help with an app. 
3. Application Suggestion 
	- The *Application Suggestion* flair is used for when you're *suggesting* apps to the subreddit that *you did not create*. For apps you created, please use the *Application Release* or *Development* flairs. If you're looking for an app, please use *Application Request*. 
4. Application Release 
	- The *Application Release* flair is used for any app releases, *when you created the app*. If you did not create it, please use *Application Suggestion*. 
	- For app updates, please use *Development*. This flair is for *new apps only*. 
5. Privacy
	- The *Privacy* flair is used for privacy updates, privacy tools, and anything else relating to privacy. Some posts with this flair may fall under other flairs as well, but this flair should be used for privacy-specific posts. 
6. Other
	- The *Other* flair is used when your post doesn't fit any other flairs. This is not a common situation, and often results in posts that don't meet our subreddit. Please make sure that your post meets the subreddit before using this flair, and that no other flairs apply. 
7. Meta
	- The *Meta* flair is for any meta-posts, or *posts about the subreddit*. This is most commonly used by mods for providing updates to the subreddit. 
8. Development 
	- The *Development* flair is used for discussing projects pre-release or post-release, when developers are involved in the discussion. This can be used for app updates, developers sharing ideas and asking for community feedback, and more. 
9. F-Droid
	- The *F-Droid* flair is used for discussions around F-Droid and F-Droid companion apps and alternative store apps such as Droidify.
# Source Code Licensing 
> When posting apps, please add the source license of the software you're posting (GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.). This should be at either the top or bottom of your post, or if you're posting multiple apps, please mention it with it. 

*Rule 3, r/FOSSdroid*

When posting with the *Application Suggestion,* *Application Release,* and *Development* flairs, please ensure that you list the open-source license used. If you're posting something with a proprietary/EULA license, please contact mods before doing so to ensure that your post will not be removed. We will review their license and make a determination as to whether it is considered FOSS for the purposes of the subreddit. 

[What is FOSS? (FOSSdroid.org)](https://fossdroid.org/what-is-foss.html)

This is important because some users may consider what license an app is before installing it. Additionally, listing the license enhances the search experience by allowing people to search for specific licenses. Listing the license also allows us to more easily verify automatically whether a given app *has* a license, and whether it fits our definition of FOSS. One automoderator rule checks if a post contains both a link to certain APK distribution methods, as well as to check whether a known FOSS license is included. 
# What is spam? 
In addition to the common uses of spam on Reddit, we also count links to suspicious websites as spam. This includes Telegram and certain other sites. This is because historically these sites were used for spam, advertising, and scamming on our subreddit. As such, we have a filter set up to remove such posts (pending mod review). 

# No VPNs
> Any post asking for a VPN suggestion or shilling a VPN will be removed. Mullvad and ProtonVPN are good options. Do not use a free VPN. VPNs are not in scope for this subreddit and are frequently a target of bots. 

*Rule 8, r/FOSSdroid*

Because of VPN spammers and shills, we have banned all VPN posts. Additionally, VPNs *are not privacy tools*. Because of the prevalence of bad marketing in the VPN industry, many people have misconceptions about VPNs. All they do is hide your IP address. They do not protect you from trackers or hackers. While it is true that they prevent a man-in-the-middle attack on public WIFI networks, this is only true for HTTP websites. HTTPS websites, including our [FOSSdroid.org](https://fossdroid.org), are not vulnerable to a MITM attack unless the attacker has access to a CA (certificate authority) and the origin domain does not have DNSSEC enabled. VPNs do also hide your network traffic from your ISP, but they also show your network traffic to your VPN provider. HTTPS traffic cannot have it's contents spoofed, but they can still figure out who you might be connecting to based on DNS queries or IP addresses. If you use a DNS-over-HTTPS provider other than your VPN, they can only see what IP address you connect to. This doesn't mean they can see your traffic, as many websites make use of CDNs and reverse proxies such as Cloudflare or NGINX. 

# Follow the Rules
When in doubt, follow the rules, or contact the mods.
